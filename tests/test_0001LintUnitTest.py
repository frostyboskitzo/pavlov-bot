This is a programatically  blank test files, run first in unit tests.

If a unit test fails on this test, the problem lies with your unit tester/environment! Don't waste time chasing crappy unit tests.

Format for tests:
    using pytest, all files in <project_root>/tests/test_*.py will be run in linux alphanumerical order
    tests should be kept common language and as short as possible.
    test_0001LintUnitTest.py should always run first
    subsequent tests should be named test_0002FeatureTest.py or test_0003UnitTest.py and should principally test a single function, feature, or expected output, to be as simple as possible.
    Pytest _can_ be configured to support directories, and if/when there are ever enough tests to warrant sorting them into directories, they should be sorted by their function in the same layout as the app, if at all possible.

Alright, the game is on - Declare your tests!
